**Firstly, I like to thank [Ahmed Aly](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmed-aly-2a462632) for making this awesome site.**

This site is very helpful for programmer. Recently I came to know that, this site will be no more. So I want to collect the 
problems data for future uses.

I am including the code also. you can also contribute here. 
I will be very happy if you contribute.
